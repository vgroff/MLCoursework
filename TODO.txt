What we've got so far:

- building a single tree training yes/no on a single variable (out of 6)
- can print and visualise a tree
- function in Tree that will divide a given matrix into lists of lists for cross-validation
- general function for building a confusion matrix from column vectors of real/actual classes.


To do:

- unify into a single model (probably array of 6 trees) based on different variables DONE
- come up with a single classifier for the overall model (suggest highest probability for the case of >1 positive, or lowest probability if no positives) DONE
- come up with the testing routine for the k-fold cross validation, building the confusion matrix DONE
- Get the performance metrics from confusion matrix DONE
- figure out the pruning routine which is automated for MATLAB, not sure how to adapt it to Python yet.
